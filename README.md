# Templates
The `~templates` folders contains a few (not a lot) of template files, mainly for Thymeleaf stuff in HTML.  

# Spring
I'm not gonna bother including a template project for Spring here, since its super easy to create one in VS Code 
with the Spring Initialzr extension. But...  

Typical dependencies:
* Spring Boot Actuator
* Spring Web
* Spring Boot DevTools
* Thymeleaf
* Lombok

Project structure:
* Root Package (com.example.demo)
	* Controllers (com.example.demo.controllers)
	* Models (com.example.demo.models)
	* Repositories (com.example.demo.repositories)
	* Services (com.example.demo.services)
	
Maybe I will throw in a template project. 


# Git Info
The plan is to keep main clean, with just this readme and the template 
files. Every time we need to create a project in class, create a new 
branch off main and work in that branch. At the end of the term, either
merge everything back down to main, or just leave it. Not like it matters
a ton anyways.
